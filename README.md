*** Budget App ***
This is the third project toward gaining the scientific computing in python certificate with freeCodeCamp.

In the budget_app.py file, I create a class called Category and a function called create_spend_chart.
The Category class includes attributes to create a ledger of transactions and has methods such as deposits, withdrawals, transfers for a given budget category. 
The create_spend_chart function prints a bar chart representing the percentage of total money spent in a category.
